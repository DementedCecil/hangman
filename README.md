# Hangman

This Hangman game allows a user to try to guess a random word by selecting letters.  The user gets 10 wrong turns before the Hangman image is complete, at which point the player would lose.

If the correct word is found then a message will be displayed telling the player that they have won.

The user can click the 'New Game' button to start a new game at any time.  There is also a help file available by clicking the question mark in the top right.
